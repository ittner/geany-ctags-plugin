These installation instructions are written for a GNU/Linux system.

( for a detailled procedure, see the following document : ./doc/gms_help.pdf )

At the time of this writing, building the plugin requires a recent geany (0.15)
installed.

 % autoreconf -i
 % configure
 % make clean
 % make
 % sudo make install

There is no "make uninstall" target, so if you want to remove the plugin,
just delete the "gms.la" anf "gms.so" from geany plugins directory 
(usually: /usr/lib/geany or /usr/lib/local/geany).
