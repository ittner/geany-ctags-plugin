These installation instructions are written for a GNU/Linux system.

At the time of this writing, building the plugin requires a recent SVN geany (r2340+)
installed.

 % configure
 % make
 % make install

There is no "make uninstall" target, so if you want to remove the plugin,
just delete the "geanyprj.so" from geany plugins directory (usually: /usr/lib/geany).
