(Version 0.2, October 2008)


About
------

implements a wizard to create new LaTeX documents in a fast and easy
way. Also it implements a front end for add labels and refs as well as
special characters to an open document.

------------

For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.6.0)
libraries and header files. You will also need its dependency
libraries and header files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these
files are available at http://www.gtk.org.

And obviously, you will need have Geany installed. If you have Geany
installed from the sources, you should be ready to go. If you used a

geany-devel. Please note that in order to compile and use this plugin,
you need Geany 0.15 or later (Geany Plugin API v100 or higher).

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler (that is supporting C99)
and the Make tool. The GNU versions of these tools are recommended.
Also there should be a working (La)TeX-environment on your System.

commands:
