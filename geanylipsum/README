GeanyLipsum Plugin v0.1
-----------


About
------

GeanyLipsum is a plugin for Geany that implements a Lorem Ipsum
generator to insert placeholder text into your document.


Requirements
------------

For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.6.0)
libraries and header files. You will also need its dependency
libraries and header files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these
files are available at http://www.gtk.org.

And obviously, you will need to have Geany installed. If you have Geany
installed from the sources, you should be ready to go. If you used a
prepared package e.g. from your distribution you probably need to
install an additional package, this might be called geany-dev or
geany-devel. Please note that in order to compile and use this plugin,
you need Geany 0.16 or later (Geany Plugin API v130 or higher).

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool. The
GNU versions of these tools are recommended.


Installation
------------

Compiling and installing the code is done by the following three
commands:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

For more configuration details run
$ ./configure --help

If there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment
and try to find the error, otherwise contact one of the authors. (See below)


Usage
-----

After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and a new menu item in the Tools menu will appear.

To insert Lorem Ipsum to your document, either use the appearing menu
item or use the keystroke which you can configure inside Geany's
preferences dialog. Inside the dialog you can set up a length of the
text. Values between 1 and 5000 chars are available here. If you
choose a length that is not fitting with the length of the Lipsum
snippet shipped with this plugin it will be repeated and cut so you
will always get the wished number of chars inserted.


Development
-----------

You can checkout the current source code from the Subversion repository at
Sourceforge.net. Get the code from:

svn checkout
http://geany-plugins.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geany-plugins/trunk/geanylipsum
