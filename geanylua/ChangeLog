Mar 24, 2008
  Released version 0.7.0

Mar 23, 2008
  Added a new examples folder "work" with three new scripts:
    edit-test-script.lua; run-test-script.lua; install-test-script.lua
  These should make it a little easier for users to develop and save
  their own personal scripts.
  Also added "examples/edit/calculator.lua" -
  The idea came from the "Plugin Wishlist" on the Geany website, only
  this one can even do some fancy stuff like 'sqrt(pi^2*sin(rad(45)))'

Mar 14, 2008
  Revised configure.in and Makefile.am to support Geany's new header
  installation and pkg-config features, so the build configuration
  no longer requires the --with-geany-src option.

Mar 13, 2008
  Added support for Geany's new built-in keybinding API.
  This means that scripts can now take advantage of Geany's
  preferences system to configure keybindings.
  See ./docs/geanylua-keys.html for more info.

Feb 21, 2008
  Code cleanup to quiet some compiler warnings.
  Fix to compile with -DGEANY_DISABLE_DEPRECATED flag.

Feb 21, 2008
  New function: optimize() disables line info and elapsed time counter
  for scripts that need all the CPU time they can get.
  Also found and fixed a nasty crash bug in the filter-parsing code for
  the pickfile() function.

Feb 20, 2008
  Added a copy of Enrico Colombini and Thomas Lauer's "Lua Short Reference"
  to the GeanyLua docs. This provides a convenient and concise guide to the
  Lua language and its core libraries.

Feb 19, 2008
  Removed gtk_main_iteration() loop from glspi_run_script() in glspi_run.c.
  I am not even sure why it was there, possibly it was needed for something,
  but maybe it just seemed like a good idea at the time. It was causing some
  scripts to hang under certain conditions, particularly when event scripts
  were invoked while the GeanyDebug plugin was running.

Feb 12, 2008
  Fixed missing symbols in Win32 library.
  ( Thanks to Joerg Desch for reporting. )

Jan 28, 2008
  Released version 0.6.1
  Note that the pre-compiled binaries availiable on the website are now
  statically linked to Lua-5.1.3 instead of 5.1.2. This was a bugfix-only
  release of Lua, and since most of the bugs were fairly obscure and trivial,
  it really shouldn't affect GeanyLua at all.

Jan 28, 2008
  Fixed "make install" bug where ~/.geany/plugins/geanylua was not getting
  created, which caused the installation to fail if the directory didn't
  already exist. ( Thanks to Harri Koskinen for reporting. )

Jan 22, 2008
  Added the ability to show a calltip for the keygrab() function.
  It might not seem like much, but I think it is a big improvement
  over the previous "typing while blind" limitation.

Jan 21, 2008
  Released version 0.6.0

Jan 19, 2008
  New function: keygrab() intercepts the next keystroke from Geany, useful for
  creating "chained" keybindings. ( Thanks to John Gabriele for suggesting. )

Jan 17, 2008
  Fix missing *.vbs files from "make dist"

Jan 16, 2008
  Major change - All of the core functionality has been moved into a support
  library named "libgeanylua.so" and now the "geanylua.so" plugin is only a
  thin wrapper around the core. This was done to bypass the local-binding
  restriction placed on plugins by Geany, which prevented Lua API functions
  from being referenced from binary Lua modules.

Jan 14, 2008
  Major code refactoring, trying to hide as many globally-visible symbols
  as possible. There is a good chance that this might introduce a bug or
  two, but I also found and fixed a bug in the choose() function, so
  at least maybe it won't be a total loss.

Jan 13, 2008
  Cleaned up the documentation.

Jan 12, 2008
  Added some code to help with repainting the GUI during lengthy operations,
  using the low-level GDK paint functions instead of the usual GTK main loop.
  This should help keep the window painted while still preventing too much
  user interaction while a script is running.

Jan 11, 2008
  The timeout measurement now pauses the timer while dialogs are displayed,
  rather than setting the timer back to zero for each dialog. Actually it
  considers the time spent as 1/10 of a second, to keep timeouts working
  even if you create an endless loop with a dialog inside. But even still,
  you might need to click a lot of buttons before the timer expires!

Jan 10, 2008
  Revamped the ugly and broken goto_error() function. Trying to parse the
  filename and line number from the builtin error messages was just wrong,
  and couldn't possibly be reliable since Lua truncates long path names when
  it formats the message. So now we store the filename and line number from
  our debug_hook() in case the filename changes if the script calls Lua's
  dofile() function or something. That is a really slow way to do things,
  since we strcmp() the filenames every time the interpreter executes a line.
  But for now it's the only way I know how, and at least now it's working.

Jan 8, 2008
  The "geanylua.c" file was getting a bit too large to navigate easily,
  so I moved most of the lua-related code into a new file, "glspi_run.c"
  Added some new features to the filename-to-menu-label generator, a trailing
  underscore in the filename will create an ellipsis after for the menu label,
  e.g. "Files_.lua" becomes "Files..."  Also, any two-digit prefix followed
  by a dot is now stripped off, this gives more control over the position of
  menu items, e.g. "01.Zebra.lua" and "02.Apple.lua" creates the "Zebra" label
  before the "Apple" label.

Jan 7, 2008
  Just after releasing 0.5.2, I found a mistake in the "gsdlg.c" file
  that prevented the timeout reset for dialogs from working correctly.
  It should be fixed now.

Jan 7, 2008
  Released version 0.5.2
  Revised licensing clause to allow users the possibility of
  choosing GPL-v2 or later versions.

Jan 6, 2008
  New function: yield() allows lengthy script operations to call
  gtk_main_iteration() occasionaly to prevent the IDE from appearing
  frozen. I imagine there might be cases where using this function
  might be a very bad idea, since it allows the user and the script
  to interact with Geany at the same time.

Jan 4, 2008
  Partially fixed the long-standing problem that a faulty script can
  potentially lock up Geany. Scripts are now given a maximum of fifteen
  seconds to complete before generating an error. This fix is not totally
  idiot-proof, but it should provide adequate protection against endless loops.
  ( Be warned - it might still be possible to hang up a script in some other
    ways which can't currently be detected. )
  Also added a timeout() function to allow script authors to increase or even
  completely disable the timeout if needed.

Jan 2, 2008
  Released version 0.5.1
  Fix to compile against Geany-SVN-r2145 (API Ver 37)
  Moved all #include's for geany source headers above the evil "pluginmacros.h"
  so maybe this bug won't bite me again.

Jan 1, 2008
  Released version 0.5.0

Jan 1, 2008
  Added files "win32-install.vbs" and "win32-uninstall.vbs" to hopefully
  simplify windows installation. Likewise, added the file "install.sh"
  to the pre-compiled Linux-x86 archive.

Dec. 28, 2007
  New function: rescan() rebuilds the "Tools->Lua Scripts" menu
  so you can update your menus on-the-fly.

Dec. 26, 2007
  New function: launch() spawns a new process and returns immediately,
  unlike Lua's standard execute() function which waits for the child
  process to terminate before returning.

Dec. 24, 2007
  Completed (?) changing the makefile over to use autotools.
  IMPORTANT NOTE: The new name of the script folder is now
  .../plugins/geanylua instead of the old name of .../plugins/lua,
  so you should move any of your own custom scripts into the new folder.

Dec. 23, 2007
  Following Enrico's suggestion, I converted code over to use
  the "pluginmacors.h" macros.

Dec. 18, 2007
  Added keycmd() function to activate geany menu commands, per GeanyKeyCommand
  enum in geany/src/keybindings.h

Dec 15, 2007
  Fixed a bad bug where menu items were not getting removed when
  the plugin was disabled in plugin manager.

Nov 29, 2007
  Added function wkdir() to get/set the current working directory.

Nov 26, 2007
  Fixed a bug in the count() function - it was including documents that
  were already closed.

Nov 24, 2007
  Added a new module "dialog" to provide a more flexible means for creating
  custom dialog boxes. See gsdlg* sources and ./docs/geanylua-input.html .

Nov 21, 2007
  Added support for project opened/saved/closed event scripts.
  These events receive a global variable, "geany.project" which
  is a thin Lua wrapper around the GKeyFile object. Also added
  a new Lua "keyfile" module to manipulate this type of object.

Nov 20, 2007
  Added PLUGIN_AUTHOR define for API compatibility.
  Added a function to display a customized configure dialog for Geany's new
  plugin manager.

Nov 19, 2007
  Released "Development snapshot" (geanylua-2007-11-19.tar.gz)

Nov 7, 2007
  Added some filesystem-related functions:
    basename(); dirname(); dirlist(); stat(); and dirsep constant.

Nov 6, 2007
   Added support for two new 'event' scripts, "init.lua" and "cleanup.lua"
   that run (respectively) when the plugin is loaded and unloaded.

Nov 5, 2007
  New function: signal() to send signals to Geany widgets,
  mostly to activate builtin menu commands.


Nov 4, 2007
  Renamed source files from lua_* to glspi_* ( Geany Lua Scripting Plug In )


Nov 3, 2007
  New function: xsel() to get/set the primary X selection.


Nov 2, 2007
  New function: appinfo() to retrieve various Geany folder locations and
  preferences, etc.


Nov 1, 2007
  New function: pickfile() to access the standard GTK file chooser
  open/save dialogs.


Oct 31, 2007
  Added the ability to launch scripts from accelerator-key bindings
  by using specially-formatted comment tags. Now your favorite script
  can be right at your fingertips!


Oct 15, 2007
  Changed makefile to use pkg-config for Lua.


Oct 13, 2007
  Bumped versions: plugin=0.3, API=20 to correspond with "official"
  Geany 0.12 release.


Oct 10, 2007
  Revised conditional to use GTK_MESSAGE_INFO instead of GTK_MESSAGE_OTHER
  for all GTK versions before 2.10.


Sept 20, 2007
  Added an "open" button to the script error dialog, to give the user an
  option to revise faulty scripts.


Sept 11, 2007:
  Revised geany.open() function to reflect svn~1870 API changes.


Sept 5, 2007:
  Initial release. (Version 0.1)
