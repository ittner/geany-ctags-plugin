About
=====

geanyvc is plugin that provides a uniform way of accessing the different
version-control systems inside Geany IDE. Only small subset of vc is
implemented, but, hey, you don't need anything besides diff, log, status,
revert and commit most time.

Features
========

geanyvc currently support the following version control systems:

Bazaar, GIT, Mercurial, Subversion, SVK::

 * diff file
 * diff directory
 * diff project
 * blame
 * log file
 * log directory
 * log project
 * status
 * revert file
 * add file
 * remove file
 * update
 * commit

CVS::

 * diff file
 * diff directory
 * diff project
 * log file
 * log directory
 * log project
 * status
 * revert file
 * update

Requirements
============

For compiling geanyvc you need Geany sources, you can get them at
http://geany.uvena.de/, you will need the GTK (>= 2.6.0) libraries
and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header
files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these files are available at
http://www.gtk.org. If you like to use spellchecking for your commit
messages you will also need gtkspell (>=2.0), but this is only optional.

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool; The
GNU versions of these tools are recommended.

Usage
=====

After compiling and/or installing geanyvc, start Geany and go to menu
Tools->Plugin Manager and set checkbox at VC plugin.

You can configure the following options:

* Set Change flag for document tabs created with pluging.

If this option is activated, every new by the VC-plugin created document tab
will be marked as changed. Even thus this option is useful in some cases, it
could cause a big number of sometimes annoying "Do you want to save"-dialogs.

* Confirm adding new files to a VCS

Shows a confirmation dialog on adding a new (created) file to VCS. If not set
you will not see dialog "Do you want to add <file>?"

* Maximize commit dialog

If this option is activated, commit dialog will fit the full size of your
monitor. If it is not set commit dialog size will be 700x500.

* Use external diff viewer

If this option is activated and you have **meld**, **kompare**, **kdiff3**, 
**diffuse** or **tkdiff** available from command line, one of these program 
will be used to show differences for "Diff From Current File" command.

* Enable CVS/GIT/SVN/SVK/Bazaar/Mercurial

geanyvc detect if opened file is in version control by checking directories
and executing commands from version control systems toolchain. These options
disable checking for particular version control system. Disabling not
required ones can speed up things. So it is recommended to activate svk only
if you want to use it, since it is quiet slow.

Ideas, questions, patches and bug reports
=========================================

If you add something, or fix a bug, please send a patch (in 'diff -u'
format) to the geany mailing list or to one of the authors listed bellow.

Coding
======

Use static functions where possible.
Try to use GLib types and functions - e.g. g_free instead of free and
try to use only GLib 2.6 and GTK 2.6 functions. At least for the moment,
we want to keep the minimum requirement for GTK at 2.6.
