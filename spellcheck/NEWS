Spell Check 0.3 (March 05, 2009)

    * Reduce the delay to half a second to make checking while typing
      smoother.
    * Display a pulsing progressbar to show progress while checking
      large documents.
    * When replacing a misspelled word with a suggestion, add this
      replacement to the spell checker to remember it in further checks.
    * Remove the limit of showing a maximum of 10 suggestions, instead
      add sub menus for more suggestions if available, similar to what
      'gtkspell' does.
    * When using 'Ignore All', add the word to ignore to the enchant
      session list to really ignore it for further checks, too.
    * Check the Scintilla lexing style for the word to check and
      skip any further checks if the word is not a comment, string
      or has any other style which belongs to the filetype language of
      the current document. This makes the whole plugin much more useful,
      eliminates many false positives and increases speed a lot.


Spell Check 0.2 (October 29, 2008)

    * Use Enchant as spell check engine instead of Aspell.

    * When adding words to the dictionary, remove all indicators on
      these words.
    * Add keybinding to toggle the 'Check while typing' setting.
    * Add toolbar button to quickly enable/disable the
     'check while typing' setting (#2062239).
    * Do not check numbers and words starting with digits.
    * Add option to enable/disable use of the messages window.
    * Provide a submenu to the editor menu with suggestions for
      misspelled words and allow to add or ignore the word to the
      personal dictionary.
    * Highlight only misspelled instead of whole the line.
    * Add Tools->Spellcheck sub menu to easily change the language to
      use for spell checking.
    * Add "check as you type" feature.


Spell Check 0.1 (May 15, 2008)
