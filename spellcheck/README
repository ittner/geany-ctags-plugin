Spell Check Plugin
------------------


About
-----
This plugin checks the content of the current document in Geany with the spell
check program Aspell. You can also select a certain text passage, then the
plugin will only check the selected text. All lines with misspelled words
are highlighted with a red squiggly underline and the wrong words are printed
in the messages window at the bottom of Geany together with available
suggestions. For the plugin to work at all, you need to have the Aspell
library installed together with at least one dictionary.
The plugin's configure dialog lists all available languages/dictionaries
which can be used for the spell check.


Requirements
------------
For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.6.0) libraries
and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header
files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these files are available at
http://www.gtk.org.
Furthermore, you need to have installed libaspell with its development files.

And obviously, you will need have Geany installed. If you have Geany installed
from the sources, you should be ready to go.
If you used a preprared package e.g. from your distribution you probably need
to install an additional package, this might be called geany-dev or geany-devel.
Please note that in order to compile and use this plugin, you need a current SVN
version of Geany, at least SVN >= r2590.

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool.
The GNU versions of these tools are recommended.


Installation
------------
Compiling and installing the code is done by the following three commands:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

For more configuration details run
$ ./configure --help

If there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment
and try to find the error, otherwise contact one of the authors.


Usage
-----
After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and a new menu item in the Tools menu will appear. Alternatively, you can
assign a keyboard shortcut in Geany's preferences dialog to perform a
spell check.
