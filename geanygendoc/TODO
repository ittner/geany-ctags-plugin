* support setting duplication in filetype configuration
    function = {
      template = "my template";
      # more settings...
    }
    prototype = function;
    macro     = function;
  This would be really convenient with function, macro and prototypes for
  example.

* Support doctype-specific user-defined environment chunks.
  Problem: there is (for now) nothing here for this kind of settings
  (doctype-global but also specific to it).

* Support per-filetype documentation type. In practice it is needed since if we
  want the documentation type represent its common name (such as doxygen,
  gtkdoc, javadoc, valadoc or whatever), and for example almost all users would
  use valadoc for vala, but not with other languages.
  In practice Doxygen seems the only (or close to be) option that would be
  useful for more than one single language.
