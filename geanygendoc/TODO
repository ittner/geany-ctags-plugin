* Fix tag children sorting.
  Currently tag children (for e.g. structures, enumerations, etc.) are
  sorted as we get them from Geany, which means alphabetically by name.
  This is no good since it reorders structure, enumeration, etc,
  children.
  The easiest fix is probably to sort the tag array by line before
  doing anything, but it would be interesting to sort only the symbol
  list that we build for the environment.

* support setting duplication in filetype configuration
    function = {
      template = "my template";
      # more settings...
    }
    prototype = function;
    macro     = function;
  This would be really convenient with function, macro and prototypes for
  example.

* Support doctype-specific user-defined environment chunks.
  Problem: there is (for now) nothing here for this kind of settings
  (doctype-global but also specific to it).
