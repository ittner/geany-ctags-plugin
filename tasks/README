Tasks Plugin
------------

About
-----
The tasks plugin goes through a file being edited and picks out lines with
"TODO" or "FIXME" in them. It collects the text after those words and puts
them in a new "Tasks" tab in the message window. Clicking on a task in that
tab takes you to the line in the file where the task was defined.

Development Code
----------------

Get the code from:

    svn checkout http://geany-plugins.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geany-plugins/trunk/tasks


Requirements
------------
For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.8.0) libraries
and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header
files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these files are available at
http://www.gtk.org.

And obviously, you will need have Geany installed. If you have Geany installed
from the sources, you should be ready to go.
If you used a prepared package e.g. from your distribution you probably need
to install an additional package, this might be called geany-dev or geany-devel.
Please note that in order to compile and use this plugin, you need Geany 0.16
or later.

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool.
The GNU versions of these tools are recommended.


Installation
------------
Compiling and installing the code is done by the following three commands:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install


Usage
-----
After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager.
There is nothing else to do; tasks will automatically appear and disappear
in the Tasks tab as they are found in the files being edited.
