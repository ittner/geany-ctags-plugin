ctags plugin
============

A Geany plugin to browse symbol definitions using ctags/etags files.


Requirements
------------

 * Geany >= 0.20 (http://www.geany.org/)
 * GTK+ >= 2.8 (http://www.gtk.org/)
 * ctags >= 5.8 (http://ctags.sf.net/) -- not technically required to run
   the plugin, but you will need it to generate your tagfiles.


Installation
------------

To install the plugin, just type the following commands in the "geany-plugins"
top-level directory:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

To install *only* the ctags plugin, type this commands in the 'ctags'
directory. You may also install the plugin in your account (i.e., not a
system  wide installation) copying the file 'ctags.so' to
'~/.config/geany/plugins/'.



Usage
-----

The ctags plugin requires a tag database in a file named 'tags' in the current
directory or any parent directory. To generate it, go to your source directory
and run the command "ctags --fields=n -R ." -- this will list all tags from
all recognized source files. Check the ctags documentation for more options.

After enabling the plugin, just select some function and run "Tools" -> "Find
ctag declaration" or press Control+] with the tag selected. It is possible to
change this shortcut in the Geany preferences. All definitions will be listed
in the Status Window. If a single definition is found, the respective file
will be open and the cursor will be positioned in the declaration line.

The tags file must be generated when the sources are changed.



Unimplemented features
----------------------

This plugin is in the first stages of development. The folowing features are
yet to be implemented:

 * Click in a definition in the Status window jump to the file/line;
 * A preferences window to define file names and other options;
 * Do not require the selection of the tag (i.e. search the tag under the
   cursor);
 * Use the forward/back buttons;
 * Update tags file automatically when a source file is changed.
 * Suggestions?
