Extra Selection Plugin
======================

About
-----
This plugin adds the following functions:

Goto matching brace and select (Select to matching brace).

Goto line and select (Select to line).

Ctrl-Shift-Alt Left/Right/Home/End keys - same as Ctrl-Shift, but for
rectangular selection.

Column mode - while active, the [Ctrl-]Shift-movement keys do rectangle
selection (instead of stream), while the [Ctrl-]Shift-Alt-movement keys
are blocked.


Requirements
------------
Geany 0.18 or later and the respective headers and development libraries.


Installation
------------
Compiling and installing the code is done by the following three
commands:

$ ./waf configure
$ ./waf build
$ ./waf install

For more configuration details run
$ ./waf --help

If there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment.


Usage
-----
Select a rectangle and choose Tools -> Insert Numbers.


Known issues
------------
The column mode is global, not per-document. However, (de)activating it
will change the selection (if any) type for the current document only.

The column mode applies to the movement keys only - not to mouse
selection, find functions etc.
