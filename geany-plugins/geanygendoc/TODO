* support setting duplication in filetype configuration
    function = {
      template = "my template";
      # more settings...
    }
    prototype = function;
    macro     = function;
  This would be really convenient with function, macro and prototypes for
  example.

* Support doctype-specific user-defined environment chunks.
  Problem: there is (for now) nothing here for this kind of settings
  (doctype-global but also specific to it).

* Store doctype in a per-document basis? It would be cool, but not sure it is
  possible without re-implementing a lot of document history.

* Add a pop-up menu to the document type selector for common actions (edit,
  clear, etc.).

* When user choose "edit current language configuration", don't copy the system
  configuration if the user don't have one, but simply open the system one with
  the correct path for it to be saved on the user's configurations directory
  when actually saved.
  This would implement "copy on write" style copying, which would avoid landing
  user configuration files just because they opened it once (e.g. by mistake).
  This is a real problem since we use user's config first, so they won't get
  the possible updates of the default distribution in such cases.
