Addons Plugin
=============


About
-----
This plugin adds various small addons to Geany which aren't worth an own
plugin but might still useful for people.


DocList
^^^^^^^
This addon places a new item in the toolbar and when clicked offers a menu
listing all open files plus the 'Close All' and 'Close Other Documents' menu
items. This can be useful to quickly access open files and switch to them.

OpenURI
^^^^^^^
Adds 'Open URI' and 'Copy URI' menu items to the editor menu when the word under
the cursor looks like a URI. 'Open URI' uses the browser command configured in
Geany to open it.

Tasks
^^^^^
The tasks plugin goes through a file being edited and picks out lines with
configurable keywords (e.g. "TODO" or "FIXME") in them. It collects the text
after those words and puts them in a new "Tasks" tab in the message window.
Clicking on a task in that tab takes you to the line in the file where the
task was defined.

Systray
^^^^^^^
Adds a status icon to the notification area (systray) and provides
a simple popup menu with some basic actions. It can also be used to
quickly show and hide the Geany main window.

Bookmark List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Add a list of defined bookmarks (line markers) to the sidebar.
This list contains all bookmarks defined in the current file
for faster overview and access.

Mark Word
^^^^^^^^^
When double-clicking a word, all occurrences of this word are searched
and then highlighted (similar to Geany's 'Mark All' Find option).

Strip trailing blank lines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This addon removes excessive trailing blank lines from the document when it is
saved. If you have 'Ensure new line at file end' option checked in Preferences,
one trailing newline will be left.

XMLtagging
^^^^^^^^^^
XMLtagging allows to easy tag a selected text, by checking for a
selection, offering a little dialog for inserting a tag and
replacing a selection.
