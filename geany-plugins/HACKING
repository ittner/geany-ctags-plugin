About this file
---------------
This file contains some useful information for any plugin developer, and
especially for new plugin developers.

Building your plugin
--------------------
You should first read either `README` or `README.waf` depending on whether
you want to use Autotools or Waf to build the plugins.

Autotools Build System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Autotools build system automatically enables some code checking
utilities, meant to ease tracking of common programming mistakes, or simply
to help making everyone's plugin code better.
They currently are:

* C compiler warnings (can be disabled with the ``--disable-extra-c-warnings``
  configuration flag) -- this test is (obviouly) run during build;
* Static code analysis using ``cppcheck`` (can be disabled with the
  ``--disable-cppcheck`` configuration flag) -- this test is run during
  ``make check``.

These features are only here to help you writing better code: they are not
necessarily and always right -- though they try.
If you think they reports wrong problems, please file a report on the
appropriate place (either the mailing lists or the geany-plugins bug tracker).
