Shift Column Plugin
===================

.. contents::

About
-----
This plugin allows you to move blocks of text horizontally

Requirements
------------
For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.8.0) libraries
and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header
files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these files are available at
http://www.gtk.org.

Installation
------------
Compiling and installing the code is done by the following three commands:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

For more configuration details run
$ ./configure --help

If there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment
and try to find the error, otherwise contact one of the authors.


Usage
-----
After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and a new menu item in the Tools menu will appear. Alternatively, you can
assign a keyboard shortcut in Geany's preferences dialog. By default
the mappings are to <Ctrl>9 and <Ctrl>0


Known issues
------------
   * none, my code rocks.. (well I can hope)
