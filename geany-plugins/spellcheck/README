Spell Check Plugin
==================

.. contents::


About
-----
This plugin checks the content of the current document in Geany with the spell
check library Enchant. You can also select a certain text passage, then the
plugin will only check the selected text. All lines with misspelled words
are highlighted with a red squiggly underline and the wrong words are printed
in the messages window at the bottom of Geany together with available
suggestions. For the plugin to work at all, you need to have the Enchant
library installed together with at least one backend (Aspell, Myspell,
Hunspell, ...).
The plugin's configure dialog lists all available languages/dictionaries
which can be used for the spell check.


Downloads
---------

Spell Check is part of the combined Geany Plugins release.

Development Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get the code from:

    svn checkout http://geany-plugins.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geany-plugins/trunk/geany-plugins


Requirements
------------
For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.8.0) libraries
and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header
files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these files are available at
http://www.gtk.org.
Furthermore, you need to have installed enchant with its development files
(libenchant-dev or enchant-devel).

And obviously, you will need have Geany installed. If you have Geany installed
from the sources, you should be ready to go.
If you used a prepared package e.g. from your distribution you probably need
to install an additional package, this might be called geany-dev or geany-devel.
Please note that in order to compile and use this plugin, you need Geany 0.16
or later.

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool.
The GNU versions of these tools are recommended.


Installation
------------
Compiling and installing the code is done by the following three commands:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

For more configuration details run
$ ./configure --help

If there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment
and try to find the error, otherwise contact one of the authors.


Usage
-----
After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and a new menu item in the Tools menu will appear. Alternatively, you can
assign a keyboard shortcut in Geany's preferences dialog to perform a
spell check.


Known issues
------------
 * Spell checking with some languages like Hindi might be incorrect, i.e. some
   words are incorrectly marked as correctly spelled or marked incorrectly
   as misspelled.
 * Crashes of Geany when loading the Spell Check plugin after it was unloaded.
   This can happen when you are using a dictionary from the Zemberek provider
   of Enchant (mostly Turkish dictionaries).
   It can also happen when you tried to use a non-existing
   dictionary and the Zemberek provider is installed on your system.
   To avoid these crashes you have the following options:

     * Do not load the plugin after it was unloaded, restart Geany first
     * Do not use any of the dictionaries provided by the Zemberek provider
     * Update your Enchant version at least to 1.4.3 (once it is released)
     * Uninstall the Zemberek provider

  Background:
              These crashes are all related to the Zemberek provider in Enchant.
              In version 1.4.2 and prior of Enchant, this provider/backend always
              claimed to support any given invalid dictionary name and so it was
              active and caused these crashes on load after unload of the plugin.
              This provider is DBus-based and uses the GObject type
              registration system which is not really capable of being unloaded and
              loaded again.
