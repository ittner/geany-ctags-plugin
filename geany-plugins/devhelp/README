About
=====

This plugin uses libdevhelp to integrate Devhelp UI components and 
functionality directly into Geany's user interface.  In case you didn't know,
Devhelp is an API documentation browser mainly aimed at GNOME-related libraries,
although there are Devhelp books for a wide range of library APIs.  Check your
package manager and/or Google and you should have no trouble finding books that
can be viewed with Devhelp.

Usage
=====

User Interface Changes
----------------------

When you load the plugin, two things are added to Geany's UI.  The first is a
new tab labeled 'Devhelp' in the Sidebar notebook.  Inside this notebook page
are two sub-tabs; Contents and Search.  Contents lets you browse all of the
books at once and see their table of contents in a tree view.  Search, not 
surprisingly lets you search all of the books for a search term.  The second
UI element that gets added to Geany is the 'Documentation' tab.  Depending on
your preference choice, this new tab is either found in the main area, where
it will be next to a new tab called 'Code' which now holds the existing
documents tabs.  If you choose to, you can also have the 'Documentation' tab
appear in the bottom message area, allowing you to see the documentation and
your code at the same time.  There is also a preference for whether you want
to move the main Sidebar tabs to the bottom position or leave them at your 
previously selected location.

Keybindings
-----------

There are three keybindings that can be set using the Geany Preferences dialog.
The first keybinding is called 'Toggle Devhelp (Contents Tab)' and it will
activate the Devhelp tab in the Sidebar and it's Contents sub-tab.  The second
keybinding is called 'Toggle Devhelp (Search Tab)' and does the same thing
but with the Search tab.  The third keybinding is called 'Search for Current 
Symbol/Tag' and when activate it will take the word/symbol where the cursor is
in the current document and search for it, activating both the Devhelp Sidebar
tab and the Documentation tab for you.

Context Menu
------------

There's one more way to invoke a search for the current symbol.  If you right
click on the current document, on a tag/symbol you want help on, the context
menu that appears will have an item called 'Search Devhelp for "foo"...",
which, when activated, will do the same thing as the 'Search for Current
Symbol/Tag' keybinding explained above.
