Code navigation plugin
======================

About
-----
This plugin adds some facilities for navigating in the code.
Actually, it will make it possible to :
- switch between header and implementation
- go to a file by typing its name

Requirements
------------
For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.8.0) libraries
and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header
files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these files are available at
http://www.gtk.org.

Installation
------------
Compiling and installing the code is done by the following three commands:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

For more configuration details run
$ ./configure --help

If there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment
and try to find the error, otherwise contact one of the authors.


Usage
-----
After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and new menu items in the Edit menu will appear. You can
change the keyboard shortcuts in Geany's preferences dialog.


Known issues
------------
   * still in development...
