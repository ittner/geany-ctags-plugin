Geany Plugins for Windows
=========================


Since the Geany Plugins 0.18 release, the Windows installer contains
a few dependency library files. Currently, these are Enchant 1.5.0 which
is required by the Spell Check plugin, Lua 5.1 for the GeanyLua
plugin, LibXML2 for the PrettyPrinter plugin and CTPL 0.2 for the GeanyGenDoc
plugin.

The installation of these dependencies is fully optional but obviously
those plugins which depend on the libraries can't be loaded if the
dependencies are not installed.
