About
=====

GeanyVC is plugin that provides a uniform way of accessing the different
version-control systems inside Geany IDE. Only small subset of vc is
implemented, but, hey, you don't need anything besides diff, log, status,
revert and commit most time.

In order to use it you need Geany 0.19 or above.

Features
========

GeanyVC currently supports the following version control system features:


Bazaar, GIT, Mercurial, Subversion, SVK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * diff file
 * diff directory
 * diff base directory
 * blame
 * log file
 * log directory
 * log base directory
 * status
 * revert file
 * revert directory
 * revert base directory
 * show unmodified original file
 * add file
 * remove file
 * update
 * commit

CVS
^^^

 * diff file
 * diff directory
 * diff base directory
 * log file
 * log directory
 * log base directory
 * status
 * revert file
 * revert directory
 * revert base directory
 * update
 * commit


Requirements
============

For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.8.0)
libraries and header files. You will also need its dependency
libraries and header files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these
files are available at http://www.gtk.org. If you like to use
spellchecking for your commit messages you will also need gtkspell
(>=2.0), but this is only optional.

And obviously, you will need to have Geany installed. If you have
Geany installed from the sources, you should be ready to go. If you
used a prepared package e.g. from your distribution you probably
need to install an additional package, this might be called
geany-dev or geany-devel. Please note that in order to compile and
use this plugin, you need Geany 0.19 or later.

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool. The
GNU versions of these tools are recommended.

You can also make usaage of Python based build system waf. Please
check documentation of Geany-Plugins package for details on usage of
both, autotools and waf.


Usage
=====

Activation
^^^^^^^^^^

After compiling and/or installing GeanyVC, start Geany and go to
menu Tools->Plugin Manager and activate the checkbox at GeanyVC.


Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using Geany's plugin configuration dialog, you can change some
options of behavior of plugin.


Change flag for document tabs created with pluging
--------------------------------------------------

If this option is activated, every new by the GeanyVC created
document tab will be marked as changed. This will cause Geany to ask
you whether you want to save when closing the document.

Even thus this option is useful in some cases, it could cause a big
number of sometimes annoying "Do you want to save"-dialogs.


Confirm adding new files to a VCS
---------------------------------

Shows a confirmation dialog on adding a new (created) file to VCS.
If not set you will not see dialog "Do you want to add <file>?" and
GeanyVC will add the file without any further questioning.


Maximize commit dialog
----------------------

If this option is activated, commit dialog will fit the full size of your
monitor. If it is not set commit dialog size will be 700x500.


Use external diff viewer
------------------------

If this option is activated and you have **meld**, **kompare**,
**kdiff3**, **diffuse** or **tkdiff** available from command line,
one of these program will be used to show differences for "Diff From
Current File" command.


Enable CVS/GIT/SVN/SVK/Bazaar/Mercurial
---------------------------------------

GeanyVC detects if opened file is in version control by checking
directories and executing commands from version control systems
toolchain. These options disable checking for particular version
control system.

Disabling not required ones can speed up things. So it is
recommended to activate e.g. svk only if you want to use it.


License
=======

GeanyVC is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the

can be found in the file COPYING included with the source code of this

Ideas, questions, patches and bug reports
=========================================

If you add something, or fix a bug, please send a patch (in 'diff -u'
format) to the geany mailing list or to one of the authors listed bellow.


Coding
======

Use static functions where possible.
Try to use GLib types and functions - e.g. g_free instead of free and
try to use only GLib 2.8 and GTK 2.8 functions. At least for the moment,
we want to keep the minimum requirement for GTK at 2.8.
