TODO:
 * Save & restore the state of the inspector (docked/undocked, visible/hidden)

FIXME:
 * Find why docking the inspector window don't work in the plugin.
   Note that this DOES work when GwhBrowser is used by a test
   application.
   Moreover, this works when the browser is in its separate window.
   ...strange.
