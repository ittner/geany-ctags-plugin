TODO:
 * Save & restore the state of the inspector (docked/undocked, visible/hidden)
 * Allow reloading after build? Useful if the web page needs to be compiled
   manually.
 * Add possibility to "view current file" in the web view? (probably only useful
   for plain HTML editing)

FIXME:
 * Find why docking the inspector window don't work in the plugin.
   Note that this DOES work when GwhBrowser is used by a test
   application.
   Moreover, this works when the browser is in its separate window.
   ...strange. A bug in WebKit or WebKitGTK I guess.
