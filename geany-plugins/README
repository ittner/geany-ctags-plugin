You can use Autotools to build the Geany plugins in this repository.

Usage:
./configure [arguments] or alternatively ./autogen.sh [arguments]
make
sudo make install

This will configure, build and install most of the Geany plugins. There is some
auto-detection in place which automagically disables some of the plug-ins if
there are insufficient build dependencies. The following arguments can tweak the
behaviour of the configure script:-

=== Options ===
A full listing of all supported options can be found in ./configure --help.

== Enable/Disable Features ==
The following options can be passed to ./configure in forms
--enable-<option>=auto (default), --enable-<option>, --disable-<option>. In all
cases, --enable-<option>=auto causes the feature to be enabled/disabled
automatically based on whether the dependency exists on your system.
--enable-<option> causes the feature to be forcefully enabled, causing configure
to fail with an error message if you have missing
dependencies. --disable-<option> causes the feature to be forcefully disabled.

* geanylua -- the GeanyLua plug-in
* gtkspell -- GeanyVC's spell-check support
* spellcheck -- the Spellcheck plug-in

Example:
./configure --enable-geanylua --enable-gtkspell --enable-spellcheck

This will force all optional plug-ins to be enabled even if dependencies are missing.


== Other tweaks ==
The following options can be passed to ./configure in the form
--with-<option>=<argument>.

* Lu's-pkg -- the name of the lua pkg-config package name.
* geany-prefix -- Geany's prefix, used when compiling Geany.


== Compiling Individual Plug-ins ==
The Geany Plug-ins project uses a recursive automake build system, which means
that after running ./configure, you may compile each individual plug-in by cd-ing
into the respective plug-in directory and compiling it.
