 * install ttyhelper and geanydebug.so to /usr/lib/geany/
   patch by Chow Loong Jin, thanks!

 * search for a globally installed tty helper in $PREFIX/$LIBDIR/geany/,
   and fall back to the users config dir if not found. this fixes problems when
   the plugin is installed to ~/.config/geany/plugins/.
 * rename configuration directory for this plugin from "debugger" to "geanygdb",
   GeanyGDB will try to automatically rename ~/.config/geany/plugins/debugger/
   to ~/.config/geany/plugins/geanygdb/.
   You are recommended to backup this directory.
