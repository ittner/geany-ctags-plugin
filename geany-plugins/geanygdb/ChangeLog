 * Makefile.am: Install ttyhelper and geanydebug.so to /usr/lib/geany/,
   patch by Chow Loong Jin, thanks!


2009-05-04  Dominic Hopf  <dmaphy@googlemail.com>
 * search for a globally installed tty helper in $PREFIX/$LIBDIR/geany/,
   and fall back to the users config dir if not found. this fixes problems when
   the plugin is installed to ~/.config/geany/plugins/.
 * configure.in, README: Be consistent with naming issues, name of this plugin
   is GeanyGDB, unix name is geanygdb.
 * src/geanydebug.c, src/Makefile.am, INSTALL: Rename configuration directory
   for this plugin from "debugger" to "geanygdb", GeanyGDB will try t
   automatically rename ~/.config/geany/plugins/debugger/ to
   ~/.config/geany/plugins/geanygdb/. You are recommended to backup this
   directory.


2009-05-02  Dominic Hopf  <dmaphy@googlemail.com>
 * src/gdb-ui-break.c: Fix a crash when trying to delete breakpoints or
   watchpoints without selecting one. (thanks to eht16)

2009-04-18  Dominic Hopf  <dmaphy@googlemail.com>
 * INSTALL: Add installation instructions for GeanyGDB.
 * README: Remove hint to conflicts with geanylua since there is geanylua 0.7.0

   or waf.
 * configure.in: Version bump to 0.0.2.
 * this maintenance release will be compatible with Geany 0.16
 * README, INSTALL: Rewrite Documentation in ReST.
