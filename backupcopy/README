Backup Copy Plugin
------------------


About
-----
This plugin creates a backup copy of the current file in Geany when it is
saved. You can specify the directory where the backup copy is saved and
you can cpnfigure the automatically added extension in the configure dialog
in Geany's plugin manager.


Requirements
------------
For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.6.0) libraries
and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header
files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these files are available at
http://www.gtk.org.

And obviously, you will need have Geany installed. If you have Geany installed
from the sources, you should be ready to go.
If you used a preprared package e.g. from your distribution you probably need
to install an additional package, this might be called geany-dev or geany-devel.

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool.
The GNU versions of these tools are recommended.


Installation
------------
Compiling and installing the code is done by the following three commands:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

For more configuration details run
$ ./configure --help

If there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment
and try to find the error, otherwise contact one of the authors.


Usage
-----
After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and after this every file is copied into a configurable directory when it
is saved in Geany.
