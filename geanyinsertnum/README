Insert Numbers Plugin
=====================

About
-----
This plugin replaces a (possibly zero-width) rectangular selection with
integer numbers, using start/step/base etc. specified by the user.
For practical reasons, the number of lines is limited to 500000.


Requirements
------------
Geany 0.18 or later and the respective headers and development libraries.
Python 2.4 or later.


Installation
------------
Compiling and installing the code is done by the following three
commands:

$ ./waf configure
$ ./waf build
$ ./waf install

For more configuration details run
$ ./waf --help

If there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment.


Usage
-----
Select a rectangle and choose Tools -> Insert Numbers.


Known issues
------------
If you reload the current file while the plugin is running (after pressing
OK), the insertion may fail. Use Edit -> Undo to fix the file if needed.
