These installation instructions are written for a Linux system.

At the time of this writing, building the plugin requires a recent SVN checkout
of the Geany sources (API version 49; ~svn r2380+).

To compile and install just follow the typical three steps:

 % configure
 % make
 % make install

The plugin will be installed into your $prefix/lib/geany of your Geany
installation. This should be in most cases /usr/ or /usr/local. So you will
need in most cases to run make install under root. If you don't want to
install it global, but on your own home dir, just copy
$sources/.libs/geansendmail.so to your ~/.geany/plugins or any other directory
you use for geany configuration files.

There is no "make uninstall" target, so if you want to remove the plugin,
just delete the "geanysendmail.so" from your plugins directory and/or
$prefix/lib/geany/.
