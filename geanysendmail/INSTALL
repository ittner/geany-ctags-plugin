These installation instructions are written for a Linux system.

At the time of this writing, building the plugin requires a recent SVN checkout
of the Geany sources (API version 104, Geany v0.16svn+).

To compile and install just follow the typical three steps:

 % configure
 % make
 % make install

The plugin will be installed into your $prefix/lib/geany of your Geany
installation. This should be in most cases /usr/ or /usr/local. So you will
need in most cases to run make install under root. If you don't want to
install it global, but on your own home dir, just --prefix option for configure.
Please check README for more detailed information.
