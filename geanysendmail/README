GeanySendMail Plugin
(v0.4: 20.10.2008)


About
------

GeanySendMail is a little plugin to send a document as attachment
using the preferred mail client from inside Geany. It is similar to
the envelope symbol of most office tools and requires a mail client
that is supporting remote calls.


Requirements
------------

For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.6.0)
libraries and header files. You will also need its dependency
libraries and header files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these
files are available at http://www.gtk.org.

And obviously, you will need have Geany installed. If you have Geany
installed from the sources, you should be ready to go. If you used a
prepared package e.g. from your distribution you probably need to
install an additional package, this might be called geany-dev or
geany-devel. Please note that in order to compile and use this plugin,
you need Geany 0.15 or later (Geany Plugin API v100 or higher).

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool. The
GNU versions of these tools are recommended.


Installation
------------

Compiling and installing the code is done by the following three
commands:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

For more configuration details run
$ ./configure --help

If there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment
and try to find the error, otherwise contact one of the authors. (See below)


Usage
-----

After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and a new menu item in the Tools menu will appear. Before you can start
you need to configure your mail client. This can be done in the
configuration dialog (details on it later). You can also assign a
keyboard shortcut in Geany's preferences dialog to send your document.


Configuration
-------------

In the configuration dialog you can set up a command that is called by the
plugin to communicate with your mail client. Depending on what's
your favorite mailer, the command will differ. A number of placeholders
are available for doing this:

* %s: Will be replaced by the complete path of the file that should be send.
* %r: Will be replaced by one or more recipient's email address that can
be entered inside a separate dialog. (Please remember during input,
what your mail client is expecting here)
* %b: Will be replace by the file name. For a file /tmp/foo.baa it will
be replaced by foo.baa.

Depending on how you like to use, you can combine all of the placeholders
to build up your command. It is possible to use one placeholder
several times. Examples could be:
	sylpheed --attach "%f" --compose "%r"
	mutt -s "Sending '%b'" -a "%f" "%r"


Development
-----------

You can checkout the current source code from the Subversion repository at
Sourceforge.net. Get the code from:

svn checkout
http://geany-plugins.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geany-plugins/trunk/geanysendmail

If you want to create a patch, please respect the license of GeanySendMail
as well as interlectual property of third. Patches that should be
included to the default distribution must be licensed under the same conditions
as GeanySendMail by the copyright owner.


Kown issues
-----------

During installation it might happen, that the plugin wants to install the
files for localization to /usr/local as a prefix. This can be avoided by
adding --prefix="/new/path" when running configure/autogen.sh.

On Windows systemy you maybe also have some trouble with quoting of
placeholders. Please ask your local Windows geek for help in case some
problems are occuring with it.
