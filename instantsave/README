Instant Save Plugin
===================


About
-----
This plugin sets on every new file (File->New or File-> New (with template))
a randomly chosen filename and set its filetype appropriate to the used template
or when no template was used, to a configurable default filetype.
This enables you to quickly compile, build and/or run the new file without the
need to give it an explicit filename using the Save As dialog. This might be
useful when you often create new files just for testing some code or something
similar.

Requirements
------------
For compiling the plugin yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.6.0) libraries
and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header
files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these files are available at
http://www.gtk.org.

And obviously, you will need have Geany (>= 0.15) installed. If you have Geany installed
from the sources, you should be ready to go.
If you used a preprared package e.g. from your distribution you probably need
to install an additional package, this might be called geany-dev or geany-devel.
Please note that in order to compile and use this plugin, you need a current SVN
version of Geany, at least SVN >= r2604.

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool.
The GNU versions of these tools are recommended.


Installation
------------
Compiling and installing the code is done by the following three commands::

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

For more configuration details run::

	$ ./configure --help

If there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment
and try to find the error, otherwise contact one of the authors.


Usage
-----
After successfully installed, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and after this all new files will have set a filename (randomly chosen)
and a given filetype(whether the one you set in the plugin's configure
dialog or the one related to the used template).
